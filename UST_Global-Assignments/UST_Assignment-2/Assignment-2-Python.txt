==================================================

List
====
How do you add an element at the end of a list in Python?

How can you remove an element from a list by its index?

What will be the output of the following code snippet?

lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
lst[1:3] = [10, 20]
print(lst)


How can you check if an element exists in a list in Python?

Write a Python function that removes duplicates from a list without using the set() function.

Tuple
======
Can you modify the elements of a tuple after it has been created? Why or why not?

How would you access the second-to-last element in a tuple?

What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?

Given the tuple t = (1, 2, 3, 4), how can you change the value 3 to 100?

Write a Python function that takes a tuple of numbers and returns the sum of all its elements.

Set
===
How do you remove all elements from a set in Python?

What is the output of the following code snippet?

a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
b = {3, 4, 5, 6}
print(a - b)


How do you check if an element is present in a set?

Write a Python program to find the intersection of two sets.

How does a set handle duplicate values when adding them?

Dictionary
==========
How can you add a new key-value pair to an existing dictionary in Python?

What happens if you try to access a key that does not exist in a dictionary?

Write a Python function that takes a dictionary and returns a list of keys that have values greater than 50.

How would you iterate over both keys and values of a dictionary in Python?

Write a Python function that merges two dictionaries.

Map and Reduce
================
How does the map() function work in Python? Give an example where you square each number in a list.

What is the output of the following code?

from functools import reduce
result = reduce(lambda x, y: x * y, [1, 2, 3, 4])
print(result)


How would you use the map() function to convert all string elements of a list to uppercase?

Write a Python program that uses reduce() to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of numbers.

Compare and contrast the map() and filter() functions in Python.

List Comprehension
==================
Write a list comprehension that returns all even numbers from 0 to 20.

How would you create a new list of squares from an existing list of numbers using list comprehension?

Write a list comprehension to extract all words that are longer than 4 characters from a sentence.

How can you use list comprehension to generate a list of the first 10 Fibonacci numbers?

Can you use an if condition inside a list comprehension? Provide an example where only odd numbers are selected from a list.
